Data Analysis and Visualization on Developer Dataset

The Dataset titled - “Stack Overflow Survey” taken from Kaggle describes the data of various developers of ages between 18-50 collected from various countries describing the developers’ favorite databases, programming languages, and IDE. The dataset sheds light on the highest education obtained by them and their expectation of salaries.

This dataset gives us insight into how satisfied the developers are in their careers and whether the country they belong to plays a significant role in their satisfaction of jobs and opportunities. The dataset informs us about how important are skills such as adapting to newer technology, problem-solving, proper education for propelling into a career of a developer.

The data analysis and visualization is being done using Python.
